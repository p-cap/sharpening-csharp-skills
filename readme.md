# Stay Consistent

## Logging my daily dose of c#
- This public repo will contain insight on how to learn c# through the build-first mindset
- The build can be an app or algorithm 
- Each folder is labeled as a day so that I keep myseld accountable to ensure I commit to this repo on the daily
- For now, one things for sure, inside the folder, I will have a jupyter notebook
- I like using jupyter notebook because it is great way to progressive learn c# but also, I can keep errors so I use it as a way to get my debugging skills better

## How-To
- build an app
- Rebuild through the technical Glossary
- Take a concept from the app and use it in the jupyter notebook
- THIS SHOULD BE EVERYDAY!
- (Optional) Go through a leetcode problem with jupyter notebook

## Using jupyter notebook in VS Code
- `pip install jupyter`
- `dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.dotnet-interactive`
- `dotnet interactive jupyter install`
- Go to your VsCode:
    - click `Select Kernel`
    - select `C# kernel`
